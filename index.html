    <summary>What is Patcher You?</summary>
  <div class="content">
    this is project made by Fluid inspired by Lucky Patcher Originally this was a attempt to make modern design version of it, but now...<br>
    Patcher You is an alternative for Lucky Patcher, it uses xposed to hack apps and do all the thing.<br>
    its not as good as Lucky Patcher does, but hey! At least brand new Material You is here!
