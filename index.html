this is project made by Fluid (me) inspired by Lucky Patcher Originally this was a attempt to make modern design version of it, but now... Patcher You is an alternative for Lucky Patcher, it uses xposed to hack apps and do all the thing, its not as good as Lucky Patcher does, but hey! At least brand new Material You is here!
